play____________________________________________________________________________

take apart magic singable dumb songs (into .txt?)
   petshopboys, depmode, yazoo "situation", assembly, erasure(vince clarke)
   owl city, journey whos crying now
   find every rush sound
   replicate synth riffs

do unreachable powerchords, guitar strum, rhythm guitar
   drums on keys - make a good map but get it from device/drummap.txt
      pick drum instead of oct (show Drum instead of 4RH)
      kick,kik2, snar,snr2, hhcl,hhop,hhpd, ride,rdbl, cras
                 clap,sstk

syn_____________________________________________________________________________

show control value types in picker
   control display should have y,m capabilities
bug = chord hide/show doesn't take effect
   on/off - always mini

ccmap help?

set velo>fCut how
new cmd for erasing rec so you don't wreck prac songs

envelopes w exp,sin curves

glide midi/yamaha specs

MAIN
   frq(snd,note,phase) oSnd,oKey,oCnt
   flt(cut,res)        fCut,fRes
   amp                 amp
   pan                 pan
   fx(send,type,params) fx2, fx3, etc

song=>syn buf for
   time(bar.bt.x), tempo, tsig(num,den,subbt), ksig, chord(root,pat,bass)
   last note(set?) per chan
   ...anything else?

syn palette list:
direct
   key=>oscNote   (duh)
   pbnd=>oscPhase (duh)  give it range of 44 tho :)
   velo=>amp      (duh)
   velo=>!fCut
   pbnd=>pan

   env=>fCut  (wow.  esp bass sawtooth)

   sinlfo=>phase   vibrato
   sinlfo=>amp     tremelo

   multi - play 2nd(+) voice
      snd=(how?)
      ccmap=(how?)

   glide, glRate, glFrom works :)
      sync rate to tmpo/tsig
      subbt,beat,bar,4bars
      glis=on/off?  (round and retrigger on next)

   glide amp, fCut too

      1 note=>multiple is easy
      multiple...
         3=>1 means this note gets 2 xSnd on each of prev notes
      how do i transfer to a new sample of snd?
      cc65 on/off
       cc5 portamento time (rate)
      cc84 junky portamento amount (??) sometimes sets previous note
           syn maybe 0=off,64=glis,127=smooth

   phaser - multi me with slight phase diff
      phase=varied how?  in sync w time, random, w env

   crazypan - random pan changing at random (hearable) durs
      mode=maybe rotating in time, env, etc?

   named envs
      turn a snd's level into an env
      random env (or random pos)

      level [dur curve level] repStages durDecay
      dur=songtime or absolutetime
      curve=lin linear
            sin 0-1  1/4 circle 0..pi/2
            cos 1-0
            log 0-1
            exp 1-0
            sinpos .5=>1=>.5=>0=>.5=>...
            logsin 0=>1=>0=>-1=>0 ==>1
            expcos 1=>0=>-1=>0=>1 ==>0
                  exponential attack: y=1-e^(-at)
                  exponential decay:  y=e^(-at)
                  (exp is reciprocal of log)
      level=amount for curve to reach
      repStages=stage to go back to during sustain

      lfo(dur) is just an env of
         0 [dur sin 1 dur cos 1 dur sin -1 dur cos -1] 0 0

maybe do away with channels altogether?
   add ubyte sync (syn color) to NtDn which picks from synpal table
                                                                (syn palette)
   0 for only chan defaults
   else an entry in synpal (which can be completely diff from chan) with
      name, sound, frq, cut, vol, pan, vel2cut, phasor, porta, pb2pan,
                   tremelo, vibrato, filter sweep
      envelopes that adjust overall dur to wav of snd (if unlooped)
         or attack phase of wav (pre loopBgn length)

      (lfo is just an envelope that repeats where envval=-1..+1)
         filter cutoff/amt for wow
         vol   for tremelo
         pbend for vibrato
   what kinda format for saving?  save in .song or device/syn or ?

   fx, arpeggiator


think/spec______________________________________________________________________

in oct, are black notes slightly offset from strict 12/7 by
   slight narrowing/offsetting for a more aesthetic look?

wtf video   prove fun-ness   get buy in
   davin n jannah.  in turret, van, living room.
   with shorty, flashy, rockn88, keytar

why video   theory-ish / pulpit
   we used to play instruments and sing in church and bars and school
      now we don't go to church, school barely teaches anything let alone music
      bars still exist, but just barely
      where oh where are you tonight :)
   screens have wrecked us
      it's time to turn that around.
      time for screens to help us with our stories and songs
   ...88 mechanical switches
      feel = tempo + velocity
      why is piano playin hard
      how is guitar better
      how many people should play a song

how video   cleanin up a song
   name it a.mid in a dir
   addin/removin cues,
   end of song controls makin it go long - can't auto kill em
   editing raw .song with text editor


backlog_________________________________________________________________________

if Hey!  device is off, it's dead forever...

eznotes - replace pattern w another funner to play one

changing dev doesnt pick next chan

looping needs a little tlc i think

how is recorded tempo somehow bein saved to learn .song ?

hearmode rec - show notes/ctrls as played;  in poz, step recording

ez should make similar sections have same fingering
      restart at rep boundaries or somethin
   using 2 hands on a given track (for 10 notes instead of 5)
      pick ? 3+LH

arp random notes

limit note editing in RCRD to only what makes sense
   dlgmov - not in RCRD;   is move to backing ok?
            upon close - "you need a practice track to add notes on"  ???

EvIns - do i ALWAYS keep trk[].e in order throughout .song lifetime?

control picker should show if control is used in song
   map cc zone1 to somethin how?
   hover should show track# etc
   pick all ctrls used in song

FLFind should search for text inside .mid files too


wrapping text in tables happens only on 2nd show
   would LIKE to wrap at char instead of word

what is messin up sounds back to piano?

StrArr::Add,Ins callers need to USE new bool return code :/

set resolved drum sounds for syn
   (or have song2wav resolve drum sounds)

DrMap list should combine all devices' devtypes' drum.txt's
   unknown drum turns into x128
   should include orig drum in list

ctrl list
   show #events in song.  0 sorted to bottom
   take out tempo?
   preserve across song load
   give controls fullname too

CtlTr - icon centering - it's always just a "decoration role" on left

control editing
   how to edit cues at nearly same time
   when hovering MsPos should find most recent ctl given time
      show it without [+]
      but which track if not global ctl?
      and does Draw do sep lines per track for non global ctls?
   editing tsig,tmpo,ksig
