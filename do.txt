play____________________________________________________________________________

play, study magic singable dumb songs, pick out riffs, make a SONG

   yazoo - only you, don't go, situation (move out)
   owl city?
   journey - don't stop believin, who's crying now, patiently,
      feeling that way, just the same way, lovin touchin squeezin
      lights, stay awhile, wheel in the sky,
   erasure - always, love to hate you, chorus, sometimes, fingers and thumbs

try to find all the good rush sounds


code____________________________________________________________________________

really test notes picked for ez tracks
   get that note match "text report" into dbg
      to notice places to make things better
   to zanarkand
      bar 34 trill is incr and should start on 1, bar 70 too
         incr always start on 1
         decr on 5
      check trill sync across hands
      1-2 and 3-4 are exact same rhythm and note DIRECTION
         but actual notes diff
         maybe ez should match?
         same for 5-8,9-12
      13 and 17 match exactly (real notes that is)
         14 and 18 lh match, rh ONE trailing note diff
         15 and 19 lh match, rh diff by last notes
         16 and 20 lh match, rh diff
         at least a resync so 13 and 17 start at the same place

test out syn's controls n envelopes

pan draws weird lines off to the right on screen

fix colors SOMEhow is _tr ctl using CTnt ??

figure out drag n drop?


spec____________________________________________________________________________

note level control of envelopes etc via "note color"
   palette of fx colors:
      name=> all defaults overriden w set of control to set at once
         ex: step5:     pBnR=5th pStp=key
             phaserlr:  envs=phaser|panl
   note color...  set only a note to phaserlr
      if color!=0 (str != '')
         note estr overrides chan = fxlist[color-1],

strum?

follow an osc?

future env stuff:
   dur - discrete   *1/16 *2/16 *3/16 *4/16 .. *32/16
         discrete2  /16 /8 /4 /2 1 *2 *4 *8 *16
         continuous 0-1
   rand (sample and hold / osc follow)

controls in gui - pad of 3 control,values (3 x droplist,button)
   pick control.  down on button follows mouse x to set value

device/drummap.txt picks drum layout for keyboards
      kick,kik2, snar,snr2, hhcl,hhop,hhpd, ride,rdbl, cras
                 clap,sstk
   drum map name in place of 4RH?

do unreachable powerchords, guitar strum, rhythm guitar
   drums on keys - make a good map but get it from device/drummap.txt
      pick drum instead of oct (show Drum instead of 4RH)

in oct, are black notes slightly offset from strict 12/7 by
   slight narrowing/offsetting for a more aesthetic look?
