play, study magic singable dumb songs, pick out riffs, make a SONG

   yazoo - only you, don't go, situation (move out)
   owl city?
   journey - don't stop believin, who's crying now, patiently,
      feeling that way, just the same way, lovin touchin squeezin
      lights, stay awhile, wheel in the sky,
   erasure - always, love to hate you, chorus, sometimes, fingers and thumbs

try to find all the good rush sounds


code____________________________________________________________________________

test out syn's envelopes harder - esp chorus-y things

really test notes picked for ez tracks
   get that note match "text report" into dbg
      to notice places to make things better
   to zanarkand
      bar 34 trill is incr and should start on 1, bar 70 too
         incr always start on 1
         decr on 5
      check trill sync across hands
      1-2 and 3-4 are exact same rhythm and note DIRECTION
         but actual notes diff
         maybe ez should match?
         same for 5-8,9-12
      13 and 17 match exactly (real notes that is)
         14 and 18 lh match, rh ONE trailing note diff
         15 and 19 lh match, rh diff by last notes
         16 and 20 lh match, rh diff
         at least a resync so 13 and 17 start at the same place

when sounds are wrecked cuz a device is off,
   can it fallback to syn? once avail?

get doc.txt ONTO the dang website

restamp pianocheetah.tar.gz with EXACT defaults doc.txt mentions


really squish track display (tooltip everything - esp sounds)

figure out drag n drop?



spec____________________________________________________________________________

in note ev, pass duration so syn can do tricky echoes and stuff

note level control of envelopes etc via "note color"
   palette of fx colors:
      name=> all defaults overriden w set of control to set at once
         ex: step5:     pBnR=5th pStp=key
             phaserlr:  envs=phaser|panl
   note color...  set only a note to phaserlr
      if color!=0 (str != '')
         note estr overrides chan = fxlist[color-1],

strum?

follow an osc?

future env stuff:
   dur - discrete   *1/16 *2/16 *3/16 *4/16 .. *32/16
         discrete2  /16 /8 /4 /2 1 *2 *4 *8 *16
         continuous 0-1
   rand (sample and hold / osc follow)

controls in gui - pad of 3 control,values (3 x droplist,button)
   pick control.  down on button follows mouse x to set value

device/drummap.txt picks drum layout for keyboards
      kick,kik2, snar,snr2, hhcl,hhop,hhpd, ride,rdbl, cras
                 clap,sstk
   drum map name in place of 4RH?

do unreachable powerchords, guitar strum, rhythm guitar
   drums on keys - make a good map but get it from device/drummap.txt
      pick drum instead of oct (show Drum instead of 4RH)

in oct, are black notes slightly offset from strict 12/7 by
   slight narrowing/offsetting for a more aesthetic look?

more obviously stacked notes somehow


doc_____________________________________________________________________________

shoot ez linux
   get your data backed up properly - exfat
   make an iso and install it

   how is guitar better

how video   cleanin up a song
   name it a.mid in a dir
   addin/removin cues,
   end of song controls makin it go long - can't auto kill em
   editing raw .song with text editor


later___________________________________________________________________________

pan draws weird lines off to the right on screen

find cheapest - weighted keyboard to chop  (roland rd64 too spendy)
                small keyboard - prob my akai
                small pc

solo a track?  (mute all others)

Info() doesn't seem to work..

wordwrap in table not workin

put sounds with banks in a tooltip (strip *,bank)

controller via joystick

pc volume setting not set until partway thru

File::Open that's CASE INSENSITIVE

pc in dark mode :(
   icon needs white outline around main icon for stupid dark mode
   and gotta fix all the toolbar icons etc etc

master volume per device (us0)

new cmd for erasing rec so you don't wreck prac songs

if Hey!  device is off, it's dead forever...

eznotes - replace pattern w another funner to play one

changing dev doesnt pick next chan

looping needs a little tlc i think

how is recorded tempo somehow bein saved to learn .song ?

hearmode rec - show notes/ctrls as played;  in poz, step recording

ez should make similar sections have same fingering
      restart at rep boundaries or somethin
   using 2 hands on a given track (for 10 notes instead of 5)
      pick ? 3+LH

arp random notes

limit note editing in RCRD to only what makes sense
   dlgmov - not in RCRD;   is move to backing ok?
            upon close - "you need a practice track to add notes on"  ???

EvIns - do i ALWAYS keep trk[].e in order throughout .song lifetime?

midicfg - keep row hilited in Mv()

control picker should show if control is used in song
   map cc zone1 to somethin how?
   hover should show track# etc
   pick all ctrls used in song

StrArr::Add,Ins callers need to USE new bool return code :/

set resolved drum sounds for syn
   (or have song2wav resolve drum sounds)

DrMap list should combine all devices' devtypes' drum.txt's
   unknown drum turns into x128
   should include orig drum in list

ctrl list
   show #events in song.  0 sorted to bottom
   take out tempo?
   preserve across song load
   give controls fullname too

CtlTr - icon centering - cuz just a "decoration role" on left

control editing
   how to edit cues at nearly same time
   when hovering MsPos should find most recent ctl given time
      show it without [+]
      but which track if not global ctl?
      and does Draw do sep lines per track for non global ctls?
   editing tsig,tmpo,ksig
