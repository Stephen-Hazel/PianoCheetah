play____________________________________________________________________________

take apart magic singable dumb songs (into .txt?)
   petshopboys, yazoo "situation", assembly, erasure(vince clarke) - study synth
 notes
   journey whos crying now
   find every rush sound

do impossible piano things
   big powerchords, unreachable, guitar strum, rhythm guitar
   play drums on keys - make a good map
   replace pattern w another funner to play one


syn_____________________________________________________________________________

glide
   try glissando (round,2)
   ctrl to turn it on/off for chan
   how to set dur - set to subbt, beat, bar (of tempo)
   glide amp, cut too

boils to frq,phase,fltCut,fltAmt,amp,pan

multi sounds  (phasor is multi with itself and phase onna env/cc)

buf for cur tempo, last note(s?), tsig(subbt dur), ...anything else?

phasor - 2 voices w a control BARELY changing frq cents
frq:  glide(portamento)  (dur setting, exact algo to pick prev note)
      on next notedown spot,
         start frq on prev key frq.  if same key, do NOTHIN
            else time frq to move to ntDn note - just try junk
      tricky:  across .wavs of inst, prog change morph
cut:  vel2cut - only for lrn;  wow(filter sweep) timed to note dur
pan:  pbnd=>pan, crazypan(random pan smoothly btw smallest subbeat)

   fancy full envelope(=lfo)
      an env/lfo is just an auto "cc change over time"
      controls frq, phase, cutoff, amp, pan, fxamt?
      initLevel*6,attackDur,lvl*6,decayDur,susLvl*6,releaseDur
      or [loop=y/n][level*6,curve,dur]
         level can be random,-1..0..1
         curve can be line/sin/exp/log
         dur can be based on tempo?  or wav len(unlooped)
                                     or wav attack(up to loopBgn)
   autocontrols that happen with each note?

maybe do away with channels altogether?
   add ubyte sync (syn color) to NtDn which picks from synpal table
                                                                (syn palette)
   0 for only chan defaults
   else an entry in synpal (which can be completely diff from chan) with
      name, sound, frq, cut, vol, pan, vel2cut, phasor, porta, pb2pan,
                   tremelo, vibrato, filter sweep
      envelopes that adjust overall dur to wav of inst (if unlooped)
         or attack phase of wav (pre loopBgn length)

      (lfo is just an envelope that repeats where envval=-1..+1)
         filter cutoff/amt for wow
         vol   for tremelo
         pbend for vibrato
   what kinda format for saving?  save in .song or device/syn or ?

   portamento
      how do i transfer to a new sample of instr?
      call it autobend
      midi has only portamento time cc5 and on/off cc65 (only mono)
         cc84 portamento amount (??)
      pitchbend between each note
         what about one to three?
         speed, duration setting for how fast it goes
         glissando to stop at each note along the way
   give syn some way to do per note portamento (only 1 note of the channel)
      (note specific pbend that is)

   env docs:
      delay   - time  to stay at 0 then start attack (dumb)
      attack  - time  from 0-100% level (exp curve)
      decay   - time  from 100%-sustain level
      sustain - level to decay to that lasts until noteup
      sustainRATE - bring level down over time until noteup happens
      release - time  from noteup sustain level to 0
=>    sync or loop ?
         sync fits full env dur to clock division
         loop restarts the env over n over
      more stages than 0-100-sust-0

ME:
   level: 0.0-1.0  (completely attenuated-no attenuation)
   dur: .000001-3600.0 secs  (can't be 0 - just del the stage)
   level [dur,level] dur
      meaning initialLevel [nextDur,nextLevel]*X releaseDur (implied level of 0)
      adsr would be 0 attack,100 decay,sustain release
      yama would be initialLevel attack,attackLevel decay,sustain release
      (just do any delay in midi)
   so default is 1.0 0.2  (no cutoff or ramp, release of 200 ms)
   might want 1.0 60,0.5 0.2  (slow taper to level 0.5 over 1 min)

   a next dur,level means calc rate of (next level - cur level) / dur
   stop before releaseDur until noteup happens then do releaseDur as

attack is switchable expo/log, decay and release are exponential.
   exponential attack: y=1-e^(-at)
   exponential decay:  y=e^(-at)
   (exp is reciprocal of log)

some envelopes can follow a wav or
repeat (making an lfo like effect)

   portamento,
      get allowed dur
      calc (new pitch to hz - cur pitch to hz) / dur
         calc phase buf incr

think/spec______________________________________________________________________

in oct, are black notes slightly offset from strict 12/7 by
   slight narrowing/offsetting for a more aesthetic look?

wtf video   prove fun-ness   get buy in
   davin n jannah.  in turret, van, living room.
   with shorty, flashy, rockn88, keytar

why video   theory-ish / pulpit
   we used to play instruments and sing in church and bars and school
      now we don't go to church, school barely teaches anything let alone music
      bars still exist, but just barely
      where oh where are you tonight :)
   screens have wrecked us
      it's time to turn that around.
      time for screens to help us with our stories and songs
   ...88 mechanical switches
      feel = tempo + velocity
      why is piano playin hard
      how is guitar better
      how many people should play a song

how video   cleanin up a song
   name it a.mid in a dir
   addin/removin cues,
   end of song controls makin it go long - can't auto kill em
   editing raw .song with text editor


backlog_________________________________________________________________________

del blk of notes dies

changing dev doesnt pick next chan

looping needs a little tlc i think

how is recorded tempo somehow bein saved to learn .song ?

hearmode rec - show notes/ctrls as played;  in poz, step recording

ez should make similar sections have same fingering
      restart at rep boundaries or somethin
   using 2 hands on a given track (for 10 notes instead of 5)
      pick ? 3+LH

arp random notes

limit note editing in RCRD to only what makes sense
   dlgmov - not in RCRD;   is move to backing ok?
            upon close - "you need a practice track to add notes on"  ???

EvIns - do i ALWAYS keep trk[].e in order throughout .song lifetime?

control picker should show if control is used in song
   map cc zone1 to somethin how?
   hover should show track# etc
   pick all ctrls used in song

FLFind should search for text inside .mid files too


wrapping text in tables happens only on 2nd show
   would LIKE to wrap at char instead of word

what is messin up sounds back to piano?

StrArr::Add,Ins callers need to USE new bool return code :/

set resolved drum sounds for syn
   (or have song2wav resolve drum sounds)

DrMap list should combine all devices' devtypes' drum.txt's
   unknown drum turns into x128
   should include orig drum in list

ctrl list
   show #events in song.  0 sorted to bottom
   take out tempo?
   preserve across song load
   give controls fullname too

CtlTr - icon centering - it's always just a "decoration role" on left

control editing
   how to edit cues at nearly same time
   when hovering MsPos should find most recent ctl given time
      show it without [+]
      but which track if not global ctl?
      and does Draw do sep lines per track for non global ctls?
   editing tsig,tmpo,ksig
