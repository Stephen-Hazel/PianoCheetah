      synpal:
         add sync (syn color) on NtDn(NtUp too?)
            0=channel defaults, else...
               picks from syn palette table which has...
            name, sound, frq, cut, vol, pan, vel2cut, phasor, porta, pb2pan,
                         tremelo, vibrato, filter sweep
                  envelopes that adjust overall dur to wav of snd (if unlooped)
                  or attack phase of wav (pre loopBgn length)


think/spec______________________________________________________________________

in oct, are black notes slightly offset from strict 12/7 by
   slight narrowing/offsetting for a more aesthetic look?


do2/doc_________________________________________________________________________

shoot ez linux
   get your data backed up properly
   make an iso and install it

why is piano playin hard
   how many people should play a song
   how is guitar better

how video   cleanin up a song
   name it a.mid in a dir
   addin/removin cues,
   end of song controls makin it go long - can't auto kill em
   editing raw .song with text editor


backlog_________________________________________________________________________

wordwrap in table not workin

put sounds with banks in a tooltip (strip *,bank)

pc volume setting not set until partway thru

tophat pcm_rate wanted 44100 got 48000 :/  but _frq stays 44100

File::Open that's CASE INSENSITIVE

pc in dark mode :(
   icon needs white outline around main icon for stupid dark mode
   and gotta fix all the toolbar icons etc etc

master volume per device (us0)

new cmd for erasing rec so you don't wreck prac songs

if Hey!  device is off, it's dead forever...

eznotes - replace pattern w another funner to play one

changing dev doesnt pick next chan

looping needs a little tlc i think

how is recorded tempo somehow bein saved to learn .song ?

hearmode rec - show notes/ctrls as played;  in poz, step recording

ez should make similar sections have same fingering
      restart at rep boundaries or somethin
   using 2 hands on a given track (for 10 notes instead of 5)
      pick ? 3+LH

arp random notes

limit note editing in RCRD to only what makes sense
   dlgmov - not in RCRD;   is move to backing ok?
            upon close - "you need a practice track to add notes on"  ???

EvIns - do i ALWAYS keep trk[].e in order throughout .song lifetime?

control picker should show if control is used in song
   map cc zone1 to somethin how?
   hover should show track# etc
   pick all ctrls used in song

FLFind should search for text inside .mid files too


wrapping text in tables happens only on 2nd show
   would LIKE to wrap at char instead of word

what is messin up sounds back to piano?

StrArr::Add,Ins callers need to USE new bool return code :/

set resolved drum sounds for syn
   (or have song2wav resolve drum sounds)

DrMap list should combine all devices' devtypes' drum.txt's
   unknown drum turns into x128
   should include orig drum in list

ctrl list
   show #events in song.  0 sorted to bottom
   take out tempo?
   preserve across song load
   give controls fullname too

CtlTr - icon centering - it's always just a "decoration role" on left

control editing
   how to edit cues at nearly same time
   when hovering MsPos should find most recent ctl given time
      show it without [+]
      but which track if not global ctl?
      and does Draw do sep lines per track for non global ctls?
   editing tsig,tmpo,ksig
